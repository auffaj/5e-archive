Firearms are ranged weapons.Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.AmmunitionAll firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost.

        "description": "Firearms are a new and volatile technology, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below). These properties replace the optional ones presented in the Dungeon Master’s Guide. Firearms are ranged weapons.Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.AmmunitionAll firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIALThese game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing.

The ship’s cargo hold can easily be turned into crew cabins or another weapon deck.Damselfly ships are often used as courier vessels and armored transports. Explorers and pirates like them because they’re fast and sturdy. Military leaders use them as command ships for the same reasons.Damselfly ship owners are a proud lot, fond of painting their ships in colorful patterns as well as customizing their vessels with special equipment. Large, private gatherings of damselfly ship owners are not uncommon; they use these get-togethers to show off their ships and to race one another through asteroid belts and other obstacle courses, either for rewards or bragging rights.",

The device must be operated by another creature who can manifest a psionic power or who has proficiency in Arcana. To complete a body modification, the subject must remain inside the tank while the operator touches the metal orbs outside the enucleator for 1 hour. If this work is interrupted, the creature in the tank takes 55 (10d10) necrotic damage; they remain unmodified unless the process is started over.In Lord Syuul’s absence, the enucleator has enough energy stored to make three modifications. Each creature can only have their body modified by the enucleator once. The creature operating the enucleator chooses one of the following permanent modifications to apply to the creature in the tank:Bone Spikes. Bony protrusions sprout from the creature’s skin. The creature gains a +1 bonus to the attack and damage rolls of unarmed strikes and natural weapon attacks.Chromatophores. The creature’s skin gains the camouflaging qualities of a squid. As an action, the creature can make themself invisible for 10 minutes or until they attack, cast a spell, or manifest a power. Once they become invisible in this way, they can’t do so again until they finish a long rest.Redundant Organs. The creature gains an extra heart, liver, spleen, or other essential organ, granting them advantage on death saving throws.Relentless Toughness. The creature is infused with troll essence. If they are reduced to 0 hit points by damage other than acid or fire damage, they are reduced to 1 hit point instead. Once this effect is triggered, the creature can’t benefit from this modification again until they finish a long rest.Tentacle Arms. One or more of the creature’s arms are replaced with tentacles. The creature’s reach is extended by 5 feet.",

Firearms are ranged weapons.Reload. The weapon can be fired a number of times equal to its Reload score before you must spend 1 attack or 1 action to reload. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.Misfire. Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s Misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you spend an action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Tinker’s Tools check (DC equal to 8 + misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.Explosive. Upon a hit, everything within 5 ft of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.AmmunitionAll firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.THIS IS UNOFFICIAL MATERIALThese game mechanics are usable in your campaign if your DM allows them but not refined by final game design and editing.

The treant has a speed of 0 because its roots are woven into the deck; it and the ship are inseparable. If the ship is reduced to 0 hit points, the treant dies of shock. The ship can function if its treant dies, but the treant can never be replaced with another.When the treant finishes a long rest, it repairs the ship’s hull, enabling the ship to regain 4d12 hit points, and refreshes the ship’s air envelope (turning deadly air into foul air, or foul air into fresh air).A living ship can float on water and sail across it, but it can’t land safely on the ground (its keel would cause it to roll on its side). Its standard weaponry is an aft-mounted ballista.",

        "description": "This suit of technologically advanced plate armor includes an under-suit that can fully seal, a helmet with a full face mask and crystal lenses in the eyeholes, and a set of gauntlets. The armor is powered by an energy cell stored in a compartment on the thigh plate.Placing a full energy cell in the armor gives the armor 24 charges. A suit of powered armor functions as a suit of normal plate armor, even when it has 0 charges remaining.Activating the Armor. As an action, you can expend any number of the armor’s charges to activate it; the armor remains active for 1 hour per charge expended. You can use a bonus action to deactivate the armor early, but doing so doesn’t recover any expended charges.While the armor is active, you gain the following benefits:Augmented Physicality. You have advantage on Strength checks, and your carrying capacity is doubled.Environmental Adaptation. The armor seals airtight and provides its own atmosphere. You can breathe normally in any environment and withstand extreme temperatures, and you’re unaffected by harmful gases, as well as contact and inhaled poisons.Force Field. When you would take damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 of the armor’s charges to deploy a defensive force field. Roll 3d10 and reduce the damage taken by the total rolled.Propulsion. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 of the armor’s charges to gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 minute. If you’re airborne when this duration ends, you fall.Replacing the Energy Cell. While the armor has charges remaining, its energy cell can’t be removed. Once the armor has 0 charges, you can replace the energy cell with a new cell by using an action or a bonus action.",

When processed and woven properly, the resulting cloth is pride silk: an extremely flexible material with the durability of tanned leather. Pride silk has become a favorite cloth for use on military ship sails, war banners, and other utilitarian applications, but has also gained popularity in affluent circles. High-end clothing made from pride silk is both fashionable and protective, leading many nobles and wealthy merchants to seek full outfits and formal gowns made with it. The tailors skilled enough to create such outfits are few and far between, so while pride silk might be expensive as a raw material, outfits made of the cloth are prohibitively expensive for most common folk.One square yard of pride silk weighs 1 pound and costs 100 gp. An outfit made of pride silk weighs 4 pounds and costs 500 gp. If you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 11 + your Dexterity modifier while wearing it.",
