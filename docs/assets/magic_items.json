Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.\\nVenturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the Brutal Pick, the Earthheart Forge, the Anvil of Songs, and the Shaping Hammer. With them, he forged the Axe of the Dwarvish Lords.\\nArmed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.\\nLater, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.\\nMagic Weapon\\nThe Axe of the Dwarvish Lords is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a belt of dwarvenkind, a dwarven thrower, and a sword of sharpness.\\nRandom Properties\\nThe axe has the following randomly determined properties:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n1 major beneficial property\\n2 minor detrimental properties\\n\\nBlessings of Moradin\\nIf you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nYou have immunity to poison damage.\\nThe range of your darkvision increases by 60 feet.\\nYou gain proficiency with artisan's tools related to blacksmithing, brewing, and stonemasonry.\\n\\nConjure Earth Elemental\\nIf you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the conjure elemental spell from it, summoning an earth elemental. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.\\nTravel the Depths\\nYou can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the teleport spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.\\nCurse\\nThe axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a greater restoration or remove curse spell.\\nDestroying the Axe\\nThe only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the Earthheart Forge, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.\\n                Proficiency with a battleaxe allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Constitution Score, Bonus: Magic, Damage: Additional, Advantage: Persuasion, Immunity: Poison, Sense: Darkvision, Proficiency: Brewer's Supplies, Proficiency: Mason's Tools, Proficiency: Smith's Tools, Damage, Buff, Debuff, Combat, Cursed, Versatile","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Buff\\n                \\n                    Debuff\\n                \\n                    Combat\\n                \\n                    Cursed","sourcebook":"Dungeon Master's Guide (2014)"},{"name":"Azuredge","rarity":"Legendary","type":"Weapon\\n        \\n        \\n            Battleaxe","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Weapon (battleaxe),  legendary (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep.

Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.\\nRandom Properties. This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \" Artifacts \" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n1 major beneficial property\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n\\nProperties of the Mortar. The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding—if there's enough space—up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.\\nProperties of the Pestle. The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\\nThe pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra 1d8 force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.\\nPerfect Tools. While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\\nYou can also use the artifact as alchemist's supplies, brewer's supplies, cook's utensils, an herbalism kit, and a poisoner's kit. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.\\nPrimal Parts. As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes 4d10 force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.\\nTraverse the Night. If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature. You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.\\nBones Know Their Home. When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.\\nDestroying the Mortar and Pestle. The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga or by Baba Yaga herself.","lowerDescription":"","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"},{"name":"Badge of the Watch","rarity":"Rare","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, rare (requires attunement by a someone designated by the Open Lord of Waterdeep)","mainDescription":"A badge of the Watch is given only to those who have earned the trust of the Open Lord of Waterdeep.

It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see \"Personality\" below).\\nThe Blackstaff has the magical properties of a staff of power (see the Dungeon Master's Guide) in addition to the following properties.\\nAnimate Walking Statues. You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the walking statues of Waterdeep. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see \"Personality\" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.\\nDispel Magic. You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast dispel magic on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.\\nDrain Magic. This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.\\nMaster of Enchantment. When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.\\nSentience. The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.\\nPersonality. The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.\\nIn the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor — someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.\\nSpirit Trap. When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)\\nDestroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Armor Class, Bonus: Saving Throws, Bonus: Spell Attacks, Bonus: Magic, Damage: Force, Blackstaff heir, who must be a wizard","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Waterdeep: Dragon Heist"},{"name":"Blade of Avernus","rarity":"Artifact","type":"Weapon\\n        \\n        \\n            Longsword","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Weapon (longsword),  artifact (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"Magic Weapon.

Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.\\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.\\nA heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes 24d6 radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.\\nBenefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.\\nRandom Properties \\nThe Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n2 major beneficial properties\\n\\nIncreased Wisdom\\nAfter you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.\\nEnlightened Magic\\nOnce you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.\\nHalo \\nOnce you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma (Intimidation) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.\\nDestroying the Book\\nIt is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for 1d100 years.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Wisdom Score, Bonus: Ability Score Maximum, Advantage: Intimidation, Advantage: Persuasion, Spell Slot Increase: Cleric, Spell Slot Increase: Paladin, creature of good alignment, Damage, Buff, Utility","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Buff\\n                \\n                    Utility","sourcebook":"Dungeon Master's Guide (2014)"},{"name":"Book of Vile Darkness","rarity":"Artifact","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall.

The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \" Artifacts \" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n1 major beneficial property\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n\\nSpells. The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: aura of life (2 charges), aura of purity (2 charges), banishment (1 charge), beacon of hope (1 charge), mass cure wounds (3 charges). The crook regains 1d6 expended charges daily at dawn.\\nAbsolute Banishment. While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.\\nFailing Matrix. Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.\\nExtraplanar Reversal\\n\\n\\n\\nd100\\nEffect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1–25\\nA portal to a random plane opens. The portal closes after 5 minutes.\\n\\n\\n26–45\\n2d4 imps and 2d4 quasits appear.\\n\\n\\n46–60\\n1d8 succubi/incubi appear.\\n\\n\\n61–70\\n1d10 barbed devils and 1d10 vrocks appear.\\n\\n\\n71–80\\n1 arcanaloth, 1 night hag, and 1 rakshasa appear.\\n\\n\\n81–85\\n1 ice devil and 1 marilith appear.\\n\\n\\n86–90\\n1 balor and 1 pit fiend appear. At the DM's discretion, a portal opens into the presence of an archdevil or demon lord instead, then closes after 5 minutes.\\n\\n\\n91–00\\nIggwilv's Curse (see the Iggwilv's Curse property).\\n\\n\\n\\nIggwilv's Curse. When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent gate spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.\\nDestroying or Repairing the Crook. The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.","lowerDescription":"","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"},{"name":"Crown of Lies","rarity":"Artifact","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, artifact (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"After betraying and nearly destroying the lich Vecna, the warrior Kas found himself trapped in the Shadowfell, imprisoned in a Domain of Dread called Tovag.

Thereafter it attempts to burn 100 gp of fuel after each year passes, keeping the lantern burning for another year. If no fuel is available, the lantern's flame goes out. You can add more fuel to the lantern as part of a short or long rest. Once added, fuel can't be removed from the lantern's base.\\nThe lantern's flame can't be extinguished by any means other than running out of fuel. If the lantern's flame goes out, the creature attuned to it immediately dies. One exception to this rule exists (see the \"Destroying the Lantern\" section).\\nRevealing Light. The lantern sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible while in the lantern's bright light.\\nWhile attuned to the lantern, you can use a bonus action to dim the lantern, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius, or brighten the lantern back to its normal bright light radius.\\nLenses. When found, the lantern's faces display the following gem lenses: diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire. As part of a short or long rest, you can magically change any of these gem lenses to a different type of gem shown in the Lenses table. The gem lenses can't be removed from the lantern.\\nAs an action while holding the lantern, you can burn some of the lantern's fuel to cast a spell (save DC 20) through one or more of its current gem lenses, as noted in the Lenses table. The spell's target or point of origin must be in the lantern's area of bright light. If there isn't enough fuel left to cast the spell, the last of the remaining fuel is expended, and the flame goes out.\\n\\nLenses\\n\\n\\n\\nLens Color\\nSpell\\nFuel Cost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAmethyst\\nReverse Gravity\\n3,000 gp\\n\\n\\nDiamond\\nDisintegrate\\n2,000 gp\\n\\n\\nEmerald\\nHaste\\n500 gp\\n\\n\\nJacinth\\nFlame Strike\\n1,000 gp\\n\\n\\nRuby\\nHold Monster\\n1,000 gp\\n\\n\\nSapphire\\nFear\\n500 gp\\n\\n\\nTopaz\\nSlow\\n500 gp\\n\\n\\nAny four colors\\nPrismatic Wall\\n5,000 gp\\n\\n\\n\\nDestroying the Lantern. To destroy the lantern, the creature attuned to it must forsake all material possessions except for the lantern and common clothes. Then the creature must willingly snuff the lantern's flame with the intention to destroy the artifact. When its flame is snuffed in this way, the lantern's gold corrodes, the lenses and remaining gemstone fuel turn to worthless sand, and the creature attuned to it is spared.","lowerDescription":"","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Quests from the Infinite Staircase"},{"name":"Dark Shard Amulet","rarity":"Common","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, common (requires attunement by a warlock)","mainDescription":"This amulet is fashioned from a single shard of resilient extraplanar material originating from the realm of your warlock patron.

But some have created new cards. These forty-four additional cards are known collectively as the Deck of Many More Things. (More information on creating new cards for this deck appears in chapter 2.)\\nLike the Deck of Many Things, the Deck of Many More Things manifests differently on various worlds. While it can include fewer or different cards, it frequently appears with a Deck of Many Things as part of a combined deck of sixty-six illuminated cards. The combined deck is usually protected by a box or pouch. The forty-four cards of the Deck of Many More Things bear similar imagery to those in the Deck of Many Things and have potent magical effects, which are detailed later in this description. Notably, cards from the Deck of Many More Things are more likely to be beneficial, though about a third of them are still dangerous.\\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly. Unless a card allows you to draw additional cards, any cards drawn exceeding this number have no effect.\\nAs soon as you draw a card, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card you declared no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. Unless a card states otherwise, if you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck and take effect simultaneously.\\nUnless it is the Fool or the Jester card, a drawn card immediately takes effect, fades from existence, and reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card multiple times.\\nThe DM can use the physical cards provided in The Deck of Many Things card set to build a combined Deck of Many Things and Deck of Many More Things, including whichever cards they desire.

Your game statistics—including your ability scores, hit points, and possible actions—are replaced by the Beast's game statistics, and any nonmagical equipment you're wearing or carrying melds into your new form and can't be used. Any magic items you're carrying drop in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of your new form.\\nYou remain transformed in this way for 2d12 days; nothing can alter your form while you're under the effects of this card, but the Wish spell can end the transformation early. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the same state you were in when you initially transformed.\\nBook. You gain the ability to speak, read, and write 1d6 + 2 languages of your choice.\\nBridge. You gain the ability to cast the Time Stop spell 1d3 times. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\\nCampfire. You immediately gain the benefits of finishing a long rest.\\nCavern. You gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. You also gain the ability to move up, down, across vertical surfaces, and along ceilings, while leaving your hands free.\\nCelestial. You sprout a pair of softly luminescent, feathered wings from your back and gain a flying speed of 30 feet.\\nConstruct. A homunculus appears in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you. The appearance of the homunculus is determined by the DM, and the homunculus treats you as its creator.\\nCorpse. You immediately drop to 0 hit points, have the unconscious condition, and must begin making death saving throws. Spells and other magical effects that restore hit points have no effect on you until you are stabilized. If you fail three death saving throws, you die and can be resurrected only by the Wish spell.\\nCrossroads. Roll a d20. If the roll is even, you age 1d10 years. If the roll is odd, you become younger by 1d10 years, to a minimum of 1 year. This effect can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\\nDoor. You gain the ability to cast the Gate spell 1d4 times, requiring no material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\\nDragon. A dragon egg appears at your feet and immediately hatches into a dragon wyrmling. The type of dragon is chosen by the DM. The wyrmling views you as its parent and is staunchly loyal to you and your allies.\\nElemental. You become immune to one of the following damage types (choose immediately upon drawing this card): acid, cold, fire, lightning, or thunder.\\nExpert. Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\\nFey. A fey crossing opens into the Feywild, and you're immediately pulled through it, disappearing in a flash of rainbow-colored light. You draw no more cards.\\nThe fey crossing appears as a shimmering fractal of light above the deck, and it remains open for 1 minute after the card is drawn. The precise location in the Feywild to which the fey crossing leads is determined by the DM.\\nFiend. A powerful Fiend appears in a nearby unoccupied space and offers you a deal. The precise nature of this deal is up to the DM, but usually the Fiend offers some material reward in exchange for you and your allies completing a task for the Fiend. The Fiend is indifferent to you and can be bargained with; it keeps its side of any bargain it makes, though it might twist the wording of any agreement to suit its purposes. If attacked, or if negotiations fail and you refuse the Fiend's offer, it returns to its home plane.\\nGiant. You immediately grow 2d10 inches in height, and your hit point maximum and current hit points both increase by 20.\\nHumanoid. You can immediately choose to stop drawing from the deck, regardless of how many cards you initially declared.\\nLance. All your ability scores increase by 1, to a maximum of 20.\\nMage. Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\\nMap. At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can mentally name or describe an object or individual that is familiar to you. You immediately know the location of the object or individual, as well as the distance between you and the object or individual, even if the object or individual is on a different plane of existence. If you named an individual, you know if they are alive and any conditions they have. If you named an object, you know if it is broken or not. If you named a magic item that has charges, you know how many charges it has remaining.\\nMaze. You gain 1d3 levels of exhaustion.\\nMine. A pile of 2d6 gems (each worth 5,000 gp) and 1d10 chunks of precious ore (each worth 2,500 gp) appears at your feet.\\nMonstrosity. A Large or larger Monstrosity with a challenge rating of 10 or less (chosen by the DM) appears in an unoccupied space within 15 feet of you. The creature is hostile toward you and attacks immediately. The creature disappears when it is killed or when you are reduced to 0 hit points. If there isn't enough space for a Large or larger creature to appear, this card has no effect.\\nOoze. A gelatinous cube immediately appears in your space and engulfs you. The gelatinous cube is hostile and remains until it is destroyed. If there isn't enough space for the gelatinous cube to appear, this card has no effect.\\nPath. Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.\\nPit. A pit opens beneath you. You plummet 3d6 × 10 feet, take damage from the fall, and have the prone condition.\\nPlant. You gain the ability to cast Speak with Plants without using a spell slot; you must finish a long rest before you can cast it this way again. If you have spell slots of 3rd level or higher, you can cast this spell using them. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\\nPriest. Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 22.\\nPrisoner. Glowing chains made of magical force appear and wrap around you. You have the restrained condition until the chains are destroyed or you are freed. While you have this condition, you can't cast spells, and any magic items you're wearing or carrying have their properties suppressed. You draw no more cards. The chains are immune to damage and can't be dispelled using the Dispel Magic spell or similar magic. However, a Disintegrate spell destroys the chains instantly, freeing you. Another creature can also free you by succeeding on a DC 30 Dexterity check using thieves' tools.\\nRing. A rare or rarer magic ring appears on your finger. If you have the attunement slots available, you're automatically attuned to the ring when it appears. The DM chooses the ring.\\nShield. A rare or rarer suit of magic armor that you are proficient with appears in your hands. The DM chooses the armor. If you lack proficiency with any armor, your base AC instead now equals 12 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor.\\nShip. You gain proficiency in three skills chosen by the DM.\\nStaff. A rare or rarer magic rod, staff, or wand appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\\nStairway. You can choose to either decrease your number of declared draws by two or receive a rare or rarer wondrous item, which appears in your hands. The DM chooses the item.\\nStatue. You immediately have the petrified condition as your body is transformed into marble. The petrification lasts until you are freed with the Greater Restoration spell or similar magic.\\nTavern. Your Charisma score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\\nTemple. A deity or entity of similar power becomes bound to aid you. At any point in time between drawing the card and when you die, you can use your action to call on this entity for divine intervention, and the entity is bound to answer. The parameters and nature of this intervention are chosen by the DM. If you die without having used this intervention, the deity fulfills its obligation by casting the Resurrection spell on you. Once the entity has answered your call for divine intervention or resurrected you, the entity is no longer bound to aid you.\\nTomb. At any time you choose within 1 year of drawing this card, you can cast the True Resurrection spell once without expending a spell slot or requiring material components. Use your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma as the spellcasting ability (your choice).\\nTower. Draw two additional cards beyond your declared number of draws. The magic of these cards doesn't immediately take effect; instead, choose one of the two additional cards to keep, returning the other to the deck. The magic of the card you keep takes effect immediately thereafter.\\nTree. Your skin immediately becomes rough, like tree bark. Your base AC now equals 15 + your Dexterity modifier while you aren't wearing armor, but you have vulnerability to fire damage. This transformation can be undone only by the Wish spell, divine intervention, or similar magic.\\nUndead. Somewhere on the Material Plane, a revenant rises. This revenant blames you for its existence and relentlessly hunts you to exact its revenge. The revenant exists until either 1 year passes, the revenant kills you, or you use a Wish spell to banish it permanently to the afterlife.\\nWarrior. Your Strength score increases by 2 to a maximum of 22.\\nWell. You learn three cantrips of your choice from any spell list.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Utility, Consumable","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Utility\\n                \\n                    Consumable","sourcebook":"The Book of Many Things"},{"name":"Deck of Many Things","rarity":"Legendary","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, legendary","mainDescription":"Usually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum.

Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\\nSkull. You summon an avatar of death--a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM's choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death.

Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM's choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place.

The tome recounts both the oldest and most current profanities of the Abyss and demons. Demons have attempted to censor the text, and while sections have been ripped from the book's spine, the general chapters remain, ever revealing demonic secrets. And the book holds more than blasphemies. Caged behind lines of script roils a secret piece of the Abyss itself, which keeps the book up-to-date, no matter how many pages are removed, and it longs to be more than mere reference material.\\nRandom Properties. The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifacts\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n1 major detrimental property\\n\\nSpells. The book has 8 charges. It regains 1d8 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding it, you can use an action to cast Tasha's hideous laughter from it or to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 20) from it: magic circle (1 charge), magic jar (3 charges), planar ally (3 charges), planar binding (2 charges), plane shift (to layers of the Abyss only; 3 charges), summon fiend (3 charges).\\nAbyssal Reference. You can reference the Demonomicon whenever you make an Intelligence check to discern information about demons or a Wisdom (Survival) check related to the Abyss. When you do so, you can add double your proficiency bonus to the check.\\nFiendish Scourging. Your magic causes pain to fiends. While carrying the book, when you make a damage roll for a spell you cast against a fiend, you use the maximum possible result instead of rolling.\\nEnsnarement. While carrying the book, whenever you cast the magic circle spell naming only fiends, or the planar binding spell targeting a fiend, the spell is cast at 9th level, regardless of what level spell slot you used, if any. Additionally, the fiend has disadvantage on its saving throw against the spell.\\nContainment. The first 10 pages of the Demonomicon are blank. As an action while holding the book, you can target a fiend that you can see that is trapped within a magic circle. The fiend must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma saving throw with disadvantage or become trapped within one of the Demonomicon's empty blank pages, which fills with writing detailing the trapped creature's widely known name and depravities. Once used, this action can't be used again until the next dawn.\\nWhen you finish a long rest, if you and the Demonomicon are on the same plane of existence, the trapped creature of the highest challenge rating within the book can attempt to possess you. You must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, you are possessed by the creature, which controls you like a puppet. The possessing creature can release you as an action, appearing in the closest unoccupied space. On a successful save, the fiend can't try to possess you again for 7 days.\\nWhen the tome is discovered, it has 1d4 fiends occupying its pages, typically an assortment of demons.\\nDestroying the Demonomicon. To destroy the book, six different demon lords must each tear out a sixth of the book's pages. If this occurs, the pages reappear after 24 hours. Before all those hours pass, anyone who opens the book's remaining binding is transported to a nascent layer of the Abyss that lies hidden within the book. At the heart of this deadly, semi-sentient domain lies a long-lost artifact, Fraz-Urb'luu's Staff. If the staff is dragged from the pocket plane, the tome is reduced to a mundane and quite out-of-date copy of the Tome of Zyx, the work that served as the foundation for the Demonomicon. Once the staff emerges, the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu instantly knows.","lowerDescription":"","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Tasha's Cauldron of Everything"},{"name":"Devastation Orb","rarity":"Very Rare","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, very rare","mainDescription":"A devastation orb is an elemental bomb that can be created at the site of an elemental node by performing a ritual with an elemental weapon. The type of orb created depends on the node used. For example, an air node creates a devastation orb of air. The ritual takes 1 hour to complete and requires 2,000 gp worth of special components, which are consumed.\\nA devastation orb measures 12 inches in diameter, weighs 10 pounds, and has a solid outer shell. The orb detonates 1d100 hours after its creation, releasing the elemental energy it contains. The orb gives no outward sign of how much time remains before it will detonate. Spells such as identify and divination can be used to ascertain when the orb will explode. An orb has AC 10, 15 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Reducing it to 0 hit points causes it to explode instantly.\\nA special container can be crafted to contain a devastation orb and prevent it from detonating. The container must be inscribed with symbols of the orb's opposing element. For example, a case inscribed with earth symbols can be used to contain a devastation orb of air and keep it from detonating. While in the container, the orb thrums. If it is removed from the container after the time when it was supposed to detonate, it explodes 1d6 rounds later, unless it is returned to the container.\\nRegardless of the type of orb, its effect is contained within a sphere with a 1 mile radius. The orb is the sphere's point of origin. The orb is destroyed after one use.\\nAir Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a powerful windstorm that lasts for 1 hour. Whenever a creature ends its turn exposed to the wind, the creature must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage, as the wind and debris batter it. The wind is strong enough to uproot weak trees and destroy light structures after at least 10 minutes of exposure. Otherwise, the rules for strong wind apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide.\\nEarth Orb. When this orb detonates, it subjects the area to the effects of the earthquake spell for 1 minute (spell save DC 18). For the purpose of the spell's effects, the spell is cast on the turn that the orb explodes.\\nFire Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a dry heat wave that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for extreme heat apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. At the end of each hour, there is a ten percent chance that the heat wave starts a wildfire in a random location within the area of effect. The wildfire covers a 10-foot-square area initially but expands to fill another 10-foot square each round until the fire is extinguished or burns itself out. A creature that comes within 10 feet of a wildfire for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 3d6 fire damage.\\nWater Orb. When this orb detonates, it creates a torrential rainstorm that lasts for 24 hours. Within the area of effect, the rules for heavy precipitation apply, as detailed in chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide. If there is a substantial body of water in the area, it floods after 2d10 hours of heavy rain, rising 10 feet above its banks and inundating the surrounding area. The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect; at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin). Light structures collapse and wash away. Any Large or smaller creature caught in the flood's path is swept away. The flooding destroys crops and might trigger mudslides, depending on the terrain.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Damage, Control","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Control","sourcebook":"Princes of the Apocalypse"},{"name":"Devotee's Censer","rarity":"Rare","type":"Weapon\\n        \\n        \\n            Flail","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Weapon (flail),  rare (requires attunement by a cleric or paladin)","mainDescription":"The rounded head of this flail is perforated with tiny holes, arranged in symbols and patterns.

Vecna was, in his time, one of the mightiest of all wizards. Through dark magic and conquest, he forged a terrible empire. For all his power, Vecna couldn't escape his own mortality. He began to fear death and take steps to prevent his end from ever coming about.\\nOrcus, the demon prince of undeath, taught Vecna a ritual that would allow him to live on as a lich. Beyond death, he became the greatest of all liches. Even though his body gradually withered and decayed, Vecna continued to expand his evil dominion. So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.\\nSome say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.\\nThe Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.\\nTo attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.\\nTo attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.\\nRandom Properties. The Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna each have the following random properties:\\n\\n1 minor beneficial property\\n1 major beneficial property\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n\\nProperties of the Eye. Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nYou have truesight.\\nYou can use an action to see as if you were wearing a ring of X-ray vision. You can end this effect as a bonus action.\\nThe eye has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: clairvoyance (2 charges), crown of madness (1 charge), disintegrate (4 charges), dominate monster (5 charges), or eyebite (4 charges). The eye regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the eye, there is a 5 percent chance that Vecna tears your soul from your body, devours it, and then takes control of the body like a puppet. If that happens, you become an NPC under the DM's control.\\n\\nProperties of the Hand. Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nYour Strength score becomes 20, unless it is already 20 or higher.\\nAny melee spell attack you make with the hand, and any melee weapon attack made with a weapon held by it, deals an extra 2d8 cold damage on a hit.\\nThe hand has 8 charges. You can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: finger of death (5 charges), sleep (1 charge), slow (2 charges), or teleport (3 charges). The hand regains 1d4 + 4 expended charges daily at dawn. Each time you cast a spell from the hand, it casts the suggestion spell on you (save DC 18), demanding that you commit an evil act. The hand might have a specific act in mind or leave it up to you.\\n\\nProperties of the Eye and Hand. If you are attuned to both the hand and eye, you gain the following additional benefits:\\n\\nYou are immune to disease and poison.\\nUsing the eye's X-ray vision never causes you to suffer exhaustion.\\nYou experience premonitions of danger and, unless you are incapacitated, can't be surprised.\\nIf you start your turn with at least 1 hit point, you regain 1d10 hit points.\\nIf a creature has a skeleton, you can attempt to turn its bones to jelly with a touch of the Hand of Vecna. You can do so by using an action to make a melee attack against a creature you can reach, using your choice of your melee attack bonus for weapons or spells. On a hit, the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.\\nYou can use an action to cast wish. This property can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\\n\\nDestroying the Eye and Hand. If the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna are both attached to the same creature, and that creature is slain by the Sword of Kas, both the eye and the hand burst into flame, turn to ash, and are destroyed forever. Any other attempt to destroy the eye or hand seems to work, but the artifact reappears in one of Vecna's many hidden vaults, where it waits to be rediscovered.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Immunity: Poison, Immunity: Disease, Damage, Buff, Debuff, Utility, Combat, Cursed, Eyewear, Handwear","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Buff\\n                \\n                    Debuff\\n                \\n                    Utility\\n                \\n                    Combat\\n                \\n                    Cursed\\n                \\n                    Eyewear\\n                \\n                    Handwear","sourcebook":"Dungeon Master's Guide (2014)"},{"name":"Eyes of Charming","rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.

Not a literal key, the item is a badge of authority that gives its bearer access to privileged places in its guild's headquarters and outposts. At the DM's discretion, a character might be given a keyrune upon attaining a renown score of 25 in their guild.\\nWhen you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a creature. If there isn't enough space for the creature, the keyrune doesn't transform. See the Monster Manual for the creature's stat block — the name of which is given in bold in the keyrune's description — unless you're directed to chapter 6 of this source instead.\\nThe creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the Dodge action and moves to avoid danger.\\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each keyrune. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.\\nAzorius Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a giant eagle for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.\\nBoros Keyrune (Rare). Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a veteran (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this veteran cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.\\nDimir Keyrune (Very Rare). This keyrune, carved from black stone accented with steel, resembles a stylized horror. On command, it transforms into an intellect devourer that resembles the Dimir guild symbol, with six bladelike legs. The creature exists for up to 24 hours. During that time, it pursues only a single mission you give it — usually an assignment to take over someone's body, either to impersonate that person for a brief time or to extract secrets from their mind. When the mission is complete, the creature returns to you, reports its success, and reverts to its keyrune form.\\nGolgari Keyrune (Very Rare). Made from deep green jade with black veins, this keyrune has an insectile shape. It can transform into a giant scorpion for up to 6 hours. The scorpion has an Intelligence of 4 and can communicate with you telepathically while it is within 60 feet of you, though its messages are largely limited to describing the passage of potential prey.\\nGruul Keyrune (Rare). This crude keyrune is cobbled together from bits of rubble, broken glass, bone, and animal hair. One end resembles a horned beast. On command, the keyrune transforms into a ceratok, a horned creature much like a rhinoceros (and with the same statistics). It remains in its ceratok form for 1 hour.\\nIzzet Keyrune (Rare). Formed of carved and polished red and blue stone, the keyrune includes bits of cable and wire. One end resembles a humanlike head, suggesting the jagged elemental form of the galvanice weird (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that it can become for a duration of 3 hours. In this form, it will serve you as a bodyguard, lift and carry things for you, act as a test subject for your experiments, or aid you in any other way that its capabilities allow.\\nOrzhov Keyrune (Rare). This keyrune is carved from white marble with veins of black. The end is shaped like a thrull's head, with a gold faceplate affixed. On command, the keyrune transforms into a winged thrull (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 2 hours. If you don't come from an Orzhov oligarch family, it serves you grudgingly, clownishly aping your movements and mannerisms while carrying out your orders.\\nRakdos Keyrune (Uncommon). This dark granite keyrune is marbled with scarlet veins and carved with the leering visage of a mischievous demon. When activated, it transforms into a cackler (see chapter 6 for the stat block) for up to 1 hour.\\nSelesnya Keyrune (Rare). Carved from white and green marble in the shape of a wolf's head, this keyrune transforms into a dire wolf. The wolf persists for 8 hours. Its Intelligence is 6, and it understands Elvish and Sylvan but can't speak those languages. While it is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with each other telepathically.\\nSimic Keyrune (Uncommon). This keyrune is assembled from coral, mother-of-pearl, and chrome and adorned with the spirals and curves characteristic of Simic ornamentation. The head resembles the shell of a sea creature. On command, the keyrune turns into a category 1 krasis (see chapter 6 for the stat block) that has the Grabber and Stabilizing Legs adaptations. The transformation lasts for up to 5 hours.","lowerDescription":"Notes: member of the relevant guild","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica"},{"name":"Guild Signet","rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Ring","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Ring, uncommon (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"This ring, adorned with the symbol of a guild, allows you to cast one spell closely associated with that guild, as shown in the Guild Signet Spells table.

The cauldron has two forms. Only Iggwilv or Baba Yaga can change the cauldron from one form to another (by using an action to touch it), which either can do without being attuned to the item. In its first form, the cauldron is made of solid gold and embossed on the outside with images of bare-branched trees, falling leaves, and broomsticks. In its second form, the cauldron is made of iron and embossed on the outside with images of bats, toads, cats, lizards, and snakes—eight of each animal. In either form, the cauldron is roughly 3 feet in diameter and has a 2-foot-wide mouth, a round lid with a molded handle at the top, and eight clawed feet for stability. The cauldron weighs 80 pounds when empty, and it can hold up to 100 gallons of liquid.\\nAttunement. Any Humanoid creature that attunes to the cauldron must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be aged to the point of decrepitude. In this state, the creature's speed is halved, the range of its vision and hearing is reduced to 30 feet, and it has disadvantage on all ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws. The creature will reach the end of its natural life span in 3d8 days. Only a wish spell or divine intervention can reverse this aging effect on the creature.\\nThree hags can attune to the cauldron simultaneously, provided they have formed a coven. If the coven disbands, the attunement ends for all three hags.\\nRandom Properties. Regardless of the form it takes, the cauldron has the following random properties:\\n\\n1 minor beneficial property (determined by rolling on the Minor Beneficial Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\\n1 minor detrimental property (determined by rolling on the Minor Detrimental Properties table in the Dungeon Master's Guide)\\n\\nGold Cauldron. The gold cauldron has the following properties:\\n\\nIf water is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it transforms into a hearty, hot stew that provides one nourishing meal for up to four people per gallon of water used. The stew remains hot while in the cauldron, then cools naturally after it is removed. The outside of the cauldron remains safe to touch despite the heat of the stew.\\nIf wine is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 10 minutes, it transforms into a magical elixir that fortifies up to four people per gallon of wine used. Any creature that imbibes the elixir gains 10 temporary hit points. Any of the elixir that isn't consumed within 1 hour vanishes. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\\nWhen the cauldron is filled with 90 gallons of water mixed with 10 gallons of wine, it can be used as the focus for a scrying spell. When this spell is cast using the cauldron as its focus, the target of the spell fails its saving throw automatically, and the spell works even if its caster and the target are on different planes of existence. When the spell ends, all the liquid in the cauldron vanishes.\\nDipping the bristles of an ordinary broom into the water-filled cauldron transforms the broom into a broom of flying for 3 days. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\\n\\nIron Cauldron. The iron cauldron has the following properties:\\n\\nYou can use an action to scream into the empty cauldron, which magically summons a swarm of bats that flies out of the cauldron and acts immediately after you in the initiative order. The swarm obeys your commands and disappears after 1 minute if it hasn't been destroyed by then. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\\nIf at least 1 gallon of blood is poured into the cauldron and stirred for 1 minute, it turns into a cloud of harmless black smoke that erupts from the cauldron and dissipates quickly. At the same time, all Humanoid creatures within a certain radius of the cauldron fall unconscious for 1 hour, except those that are attuned to the cauldron or immune to being charmed. The radius of the effect is 100 feet per gallon of blood used. An unconscious creature awakens if it takes damage or if someone uses an action to shake or slap it. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again until the next dawn.\\nTying a dead frog or toad to the end of an ordinary branch and dipping it in the water-filled cauldron transforms the branch into a wand of polymorph with 3 charges. This wand can't recharge and crumbles to ashes when its final charge is expended. Once used, this property of the cauldron can't be used again for 8 days.\\nIf you spend 1 minute touching the cauldron with a unicorn's horn while reciting the poem called \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" (see the accompanying sidebar), all creatures within 1,000 feet of the cauldron except those that are attuned to it become frozen in time. A time-frozen creature is incapacitated, can't move or speak,doesn't age, and is unaware of its surroundings or the passage of time. Moreover, it can't be moved,harmed in any way,or affected by any other magic.All other conditions and effects on the creature are suppressed until it is no longer frozen in time.Destroying the cauldron,sending it to another plane of existence,or touching it with a unicorn's horn for 1 minute while reciting \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" ends the time-freezing effect on all creatures. The effect also ends on any creature that comes into contact with an antimagic field or is touched by a unicorn's horn.\\n\\nDestroying the Cauldron. The cauldron is a Medium object with AC 19, 80 hit points, and immunity to damage from any source other than a flame tongue or frost brand weapon. Reducing the cauldron to 0 hit points with such a weapon shatters the cauldron into eight pieces of roughly equal size, whereupon all ongoing effects created by the cauldron end as it loses its magic.\\nThe destruction of Iggwilv's Cauldron causes all hags in the multiverse to lose the Shared Spellcasting trait gained by being in a coven (see the \"Hag Covens\" sidebar in the Monster Manual).\\nReconstructing the Cauldron. If all eight pieces of the shattered cauldron are within 5 feet of one another, a wish spell can reassemble them, restoring the cauldron and all its properties. The cauldron's reconstruction also restores the Shared Spellcasting trait of hag covens throughout the multiverse.\\n\\nTHE WITCH QUEEN'S CAULDRON\\nAs explained in the description of Iggwilv's Cauldron, the poem titled \"The Witch Queen's Cauldron\" is an incantation that hints at the time-freezing property of the artifact:\\nEight cats perch atop eight dead attending Eight lizards flee from eight cats scavenging Eight toads climbing meet eight dead and falling Eight snakes sneak under eight bats screaming Eight eyes open, always dreaming All on the cauldron that is ever seeming",

The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\\nThe tower is made of adamantine,and its magic prevents it from being tipped over.The roof,the door,and the walls each have 100 hit points,immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons,and resistance to all other damage.Only a wish spell can repair the fortress(this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower).Each casting of wish causes the roof,the door,or one wall to regain 50 hit points.",

The prophecies of this deck of cards also revealed great evils and guided its creator into the path of nefarious forces. Untold times the deck's creator,Mother Luba,narrowly escaped doom,spared only by her keen insights.But even for her,not all wickedness could be escaped.In the most dire cases,Mother Luba managed to ensnare beings of pure evil amid the strands of fate,imprisoning them within her tarokka deck.There these foul spirits dwell still,trapped within a nether-realm hidden amid shuffling cards,waiting for fate to turn foul—as it inevitably will.\\nLike all tarokka decks,the Tarokka of Souls is a lavishly illustrated collection of fifty-four cards,comprising the fourteen cards of the high deck and forty other cards divided into four suits:coins,glyphs,stars,and swords.\\nRandom Properties.The artifact has the following random properties,which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the \"Artifact's\" section of the Dungeon Master's Guide:\\n\\n2 minor detrimental properties\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n\\nSpells. While holding the deck, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: comprehend languages, detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, locate object, or scrying. Once you use the deck to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\\nEnduring Vision.While holding the deck,you automatically succeed on Constitution saving throws made to maintain your concentration on divination spells.\\nTwist of Fate.As an action,you can draw a card from the deck and twist the fortune of another creature you can see within 15 feet of you.Choose one of the following effects:\\nWeal.The creature has advantage on attack rolls,ability checks,and saving throws for the next hour.\\nWoe.The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls,ability checks,and saving throws for the next hour.\\nThe deck can be used in this way twice,and you regain all expended uses at the next dawn.\\nPrisoners of Fate.Whenever you use the Twist of Fate property,there is a chance that one of the souls trapped in the deck escapes.Roll d100 and consult the Souls of the Tarokka table.If you roll one of the high cards,the soul associated with it escapes.You can find its statistics in the Monster Manual.If you roll a soul that has already escaped,roll again.\\n \\nSouls of the Tarokka \\n \\n \\n \\nd100 \\nCard \\nSoul \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 \\nArtifact \\nFlameskull \\n \\n \\n2 \\nBeast \\nWraith \\n \\n \\n3 \\nBroken One \\nBanshee \\n \\n \\n4 \\nDarklord \\nVampire \\n \\n \\n5 \\nDonjon \\nMummy \\n \\n \\n6 \\nExecutioner \\nDeath knight \\n \\n \\n7 \\nGhost \\nGhost \\n \\n \\n8 \\nHorseman \\nMummy lord \\n \\n \\n9 \\nInnocent \\nGhost \\n \\n \\n10 \\nMarionette \\nMummy \\n \\n \\n11 \\nMists \\nWraith \\n \\n \\n12 \\nRaven \\nVampire spawn \\n \\n \\n13 \\nSeer \\nVampire \\n \\n \\n14 \\nTempter \\nVampire spawn \\n \\n \\n15-00 \\n— \\n— \\n \\n \\n \\nThe released soul appears at a random location within 10d10 miles of you and terrorizes the living.Until the released soul is destroyed,it gains the benefit of a weal from the deck's Twist of Fate property, and both you and the original target of Twist of Fate suffer the effect of woe.\\nShuffling Fate. If you go 7 days without using the Twist of Fate property, your attunement to Luba's Tarroka of Souls ends,and you can't attune to it again until after another creature uses Twist of Fate on you.\\nDestroying the Deck. Luba's Tarokka of Souls can be destroyed only if all fourteen souls within are released and destroyed.This reveals a fifteenth soul,a lich,that inhabits the Nether card,which appears only when the fourteen souls are defeated.If this ancient entity is destroyed,the Nether card vanishes and the deck becomes a normal tarokka deck,with no special properties,but it includes a new card of the DM's design.\\n\\nMother Luba and the Vistani\\nThe creator of the Tarokka of Souls, Mother Luba was one of the most influential leaders of the Vistani. For untold generations, the Vistani have wandered the Shadowfell, which includes terrifying demiplanes like the vampire-haunted realm of Barovia. These travelers have learned many secrets of these domains and encountered countless others wandering amid the Shadowfell's horrors.Most Vistani bands accept well-intentioned wayfarers from diverse walks and of disparate origins,embracing any who seek to find a home amid the endless roads and vistas hidden amid the mists.\\nA halfling Vistani,Mother Luba led one of the largest groups of Vistani in the Shadowfell.She hailed from the same world that Count Strahd von Zarovich and Madam Eva came from,and she created a community of kindness and resilience—ever rare to find in the Plane of Shadow.She led her people in welcoming strangers,feeding the hungry,and defying the cruel.She and Madam Eva were once friends,until Madam Eva began bargaining with the creatures of the night.\"We may wander amid the shadows,\"Mother Luba said.\"But we must ever serve as a light to our fellow travelers.\"\\nSome years ago,Mother Luba disappeared into the mists,leaving behind only the Tarokka of Souls.It is said that if you draw the Mists card from it,you can hear the whispers of her kind voice.",

The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.",

You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against dragons that share the color of the mask from which these properties were chosen.\\nLegendary Resistance (5/Day). If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.\\nDragon Fire (Red Dragon Mask Only). If you deal fire damage to a creature or flammable object, it starts burning. At the start of each of its turns, a creature burning in this way takes 1d6 fire damage. A creature that can reach the burning target can use an action to extinguish the fire.\\nLingering Shock (Blue Dragon Mask Only). If you deal lightning damage to a creature, it can't take reactions until its next turn.\\nWater Breathing(Black or Green Dragon Mask Only).You can breathe underwater.\\nWinter's Fury (White Dragon Mask Only).

"mainDescription": "Named for the warlord who infamously employed it,the Mighty Servant of Leuk-o is a fantastically powerful,10-foot-tall machine that turns into an animate construct when piloted.Crafted of a gleaming black alloy of unknown origin,the servant is often described as a combination of a disproportioned dwarf and an oversized beetle.The servant contains enough space for 1 ton of cargo and a crew compartment within,from which up to two Medium creatures can control it—and potentially execute a spree of unstoppable destruction.\\nTales of the servant's origins involve more conjecture than fact, often referring to otherworldly beings, the mysterious Barrier Peaks in Oerth, and the supposedly related device known as the Machine of Lum the Mad. The best details on the device's origins and operation can be found in the Mind of Metal,a tome of artificer's secrets that connects the device to the traditions of the lost Olman people, and which was written by Lum the Mad's several times over granddaughter,Lum the Maestro,while she reconstructed the long disassembled Mighty Servant of Leuk-o.\\nDangerous Attunement.Two creatures can be attuned to the servant at a time.If a third creature tries to attune to it,nothing happens.\\nThe servant's controls are accessed by a hatch in its upper back, which is easily opened while there are no creatures attuned to the artifact.\\nAttuning to the artifact requires two hours, which can be undertaken as part of a long rest, during which time you must be inside the servant, interacting with its controls. While crew members are attuning themselves, any creature or structure outside and within 50 feet of the servant has a 25 percent chance of being accidentally targeted by one of its Destructive Fist attacks once during the attunement. This process must be undergone every time a creature attunes itself to the artifact.\\nControlling the Servant. While any creatures are attuned to the artifact, attuned creatures can open the hatch as easily as any other door. Other creatures can open the hatch as an action with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves'tools.A knock spell cast on the hatch also opens it until the start of the caster's next turn.\\nA creature can enter or exit through the hatch by spending 10 feet of movement. Those inside the servant have total cover from effects originating outside it. The controls within it allow creatures to see outside without obstruction.\\nWhile you are inside the servant, you can command it by using the controls. During your turn (for either attuned creature), you can command it in the following ways:\\n\\nOpen or close the hatch (no action required, once per turn)\\nMove the servant up to its speed (no action required)\\nAs an action, you can command the servant to take one of the actions in its stat block or some other action.\\nWhen a creature provokes an opportunity attack from the servant, you can use your reaction to command the servant to make one Destructive Fist attack against that creature.\\n\\nWhile there are no attuned creatures inside the servant, it is an inert object.\\nGhost in the Machine. Upon his death, the soul of the mighty warlord Leuk-o was drawn into the artifact and has become its animating force. The servant has been known to attack or move of its own accord, particularly if doing so will cause destruction. Once every 24 hours, the servant, at the DM's discretion,takes one action while uncrewed.\\nIf the servant loses half of its hit points or more,each creature attuned to it must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed for 24 hours.While charmed in this way,the creature goes on a destructive spree,seeking to destroy structures and attack any unattuned creatures within sight of the servant,starting with those threatening the artifact— preferably using the servant,if possible.\\nSelf-Destruct.By inputting a specific series of lever pulls and button presses,the servant's two crew members can cause it to explode. The self-destruct code is not revealed to crew members when they attune to the artifact. If the code is discovered (the DM determines how), it requires two attuned crew members to be inside the servant and spend their actions on 3 consecutive rounds performing the command. Should the crew members begin the process of entering the code, though, the servant uses its Ghost in the Machine property and turns the crew members against each other.\\nIf the crew members successfully implement the code, at the end of the third round, the servant explodes. Every creature in a 100-foot-radius sphere centered on the servant must make a DC 25 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 87 (25d6) force damage, 87 (25d6) lightning damage, and 87 (25d6) thunder damage. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. Objects and structures in the area take triple damage. Creatures inside the servant are slain instantly and leave behind no remains.\\nThis does not destroy the servant permanently. Rather, 2d6 days later, its parts—left arm, left leg, right arm, right leg, lower torso, and upper torso— drop from the sky in random places within 1,000 miles of the explosion. If brought within 5 feet of one another, the pieces reconnect and reform the servant.\\nDestroying the Servant. The servant can be destroyed in two ways. After it has self-destructed, its disconnected pieces can be melted down in one of the forge-temples of its ancient Olman creators. Alternatively, if the servant strikes the Machine of Lum the Mad, both artifacts explode in an eruption that is three times the size and three times the damage as the servant's self-destruct property.",

The DC is 10 + twice the level of the spell slot you expend to cast the spell.\\nOn a successful check, you cast the spell as normal, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier. On a failed check, you cast a different spell from the one you intended. Randomly determine the spell you cast by rolling on the table for the level of the spell slot you expended. If the slot is 6th level or higher, roll on the table for 5th-level spells.\\nIf you try to cast a cantrip you don't know,the DC for the Intelligence(Arcana)check is 10,and on a failed check,there is no effect.\\n1st-Level Spells \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nd6 \\nSpell \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 \\nburning hands \\n \\n \\n2 \\nchaos bolt(see chapter 2)\\n \\n \\n3 \\ncolor spray \\n \\n \\n4 \\nfaerie fire \\n \\n \\n5 \\nfog cloud \\n \\n \\n6 \\nthunderwave \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n2nd-Level Spells \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nd6 \\nSpell \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 \\nblur \\n \\n \\n2 \\ngust of wind \\n \\n \\n3 \\nheat metal \\n \\n \\n4 \\nMelf's acid arrow\\n\\n\\n5\\nscorching ray\\n\\n\\n6\\nshatter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3rd-Level Spells\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd6\\nSpell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nfear\\n\\n\\n2\\nfeign death\\n\\n\\n3\\nfireball\\n\\n\\n4\\ngaseous form\\n\\n\\n5\\nsleet storm\\n\\n\\n6\\nstinking cloud\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4th-Level Spells\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd4\\nSpell\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nconfusion\\n\\n\\n2\\nconjure minor elementals\\n\\n\\n3\\nEvard's black tentacles \\n \\n \\n4 \\nice storm \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n5th-Level Spells \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nd4 \\nSpell \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n1 \\nanimate objects \\n \\n \\n2 \\ncloudkill \\n \\n \\n3 \\ncone of cold \\n \\n \\n4 \\nflame strike",

"mainDescription": "Of all the magic items created by the elves, one of the most prized and jealously guarded is a moonblade. In ancient times, nearly all elven noble houses claimed one such blade. Over the centuries, some blades have faded from the world, their magic lost as family lines have become extinct. Other blades have vanished with their bearers during great quests. Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\\nA moonblade passes down from parent to child. The sword chooses its bearer and remains bonded to that person for life. If the bearer dies, another heir can claim the blade. If no worthy heir exists, the sword lies dormant. It functions like a normal longsword until a worthy soul finds it and lays claim to its power.\\nA moonblade serves only one master at a time. The attunement process requires a special ritual in the throne room of an elven regent or in a temple dedicated to the elven gods.\\nA moonblade won't serve anyone it regards as craven,erratic,corrupt,or at odds with preserving and protecting elvenkind.If the blade rejects you,you make ability checks,attack rolls,and saving throws with disadvantage for 24 hours.If the blade accepts you,you become attuned to it and a new rune appears on the blade.You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed.\\nA moonblade has one rune on its blade for each master it has served(typically 1d6+1).The first rune always grants a+1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.Each rune beyond the first grants the moonblade an additional property.The DM chooses each property or determines it randomly on the Moon Blade Properties table.\\nMoonblade Properties \\n \\n \\n \\nd100 \\nProperty \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n01–40 \\nIncrease the bonus to attack and damage rolls by 1,to a maximum of+3.Reroll if the moonblade already has a+3 bonus.\\n \\n \\n41–80 \\nThe moonblade gains a randomly determined minor property(see  \"Special Features\").\\n \\n \\n81–82 \\nThe moonblade gains the finesse property.\\n \\n \\n83–84 \\nThe moonblade gains the thrown property(range 20/60 feet).\\n \\n \\n85–86 \\nThe moonblade functions as a defender.\\n \\n \\n87–90 \\nThe moonblade scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20.\\n \\n \\n91–92 \\nWhen you hit with an attack using the moonblade,the attack deals an extra 1d6 slashing damage.\\n \\n \\n93–94 \\nWhen you hit a creature of a specific type(such as dragon,fiend,or undead)with the moonblade,the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of one of these types:acid,cold,fire,lightning,or thunder.\\n \\n \\n95–96 \\nYou can use a bonus action to cause the moonblade to flash brightly.Each creature that can see you and is within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute.A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,ending the effect on itself on a success.This property can't be used again until you take a short rest while attuned to the weapon.\\n\\n\\n97–98\\nThe moonblade functions as a ring of spell storing.\\n\\n\\n99\\nYou can use an action to call forth an elfshadow, provided that you don't already have one serving you.The elfshadow appears in an unoccupied space within 120 feet of you.It uses the statistics for a shadow,except it is neutral,immune to effects that turn undead,and doesn't create new shadows. You control this creature, deciding how it acts and moves. It remains until it drops to 0 hit points or you dismiss it as an action.\\n\\n\\n00\\nThe moonblade functions as a vorpal sword.\\n\\n\\n\\nSentience\\nA moonblade is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 12. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\\nThe weapon communicates by transmitting emotions, sending a tingling sensation through the wielder's hand when it wants to communicate something it has sensed.It can communicate more explicitly,through visions or dreams,when the wielder is either in a trance or asleep.\\nPersonality \\nEvery moonblade seeks the advancement of elvenkind and elven ideals.Courage,loyalty,beauty,music,and life are all part of this purpose.\\nThe weapon is bonded to the family line it is meant to serve.Once it has bonded with an owner who shares its ideals,its loyalty is absolute.\\nIf a moonblade has a flaw,it is overconfidence.Once it has decided on an owner,it believes that only that person should wield it,even if the owner falls short of elven ideals.\\n Proficiency with a longsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.",

When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Tiamat, or something else the GM decides.\\nRandom Properties\\nAn Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\\n\\n2 minor beneficial properties\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n1 major detrimental property\\n\\nSpells\\nThe orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).\\nYou can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\\nCall Dragons\\nWhile you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can't be used again for 1 hour.\\nDestroying an Orb\\nAn Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Healing, Summoning, Control, Scrying, Detection","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Healing\\n                \\n                    Summoning\\n                \\n                    Control\\n                \\n                    Scrying\\n                \\n                    Detection","sourcebook":"Basic Rules (2014)"},{"name":"Orb of Gonging","rarity":"Common","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, common","mainDescription":"This common wondrous item is a hollow, 5-inch-diameter orb that weighs 5 pounds.

Standing two feet high, the orrery housing is a wondrous device imbued with magic of its own, but the power of its six clockwork components makes the artifact even more potent.\\nThe Orrery of the Wanderer was created by a renowned clockwork mage known only as Lottie. She crafted the relic as a means of tapping into the power of the planes, and to channel the divination and foretelling powers of the stars. But Lottie soon realized that her creation was far more powerful than she had intended. As it tapped into planar magic, the orrery began to manifest the darkness and malevolence inherent to some of the planes. Eventually, it would impress upon its owner a desire to open portals into the most cursed and dangerous worlds, including the Far Realm.\\nTo prevent the orrery from ever being so used, Lottie scattered the components that powered it, secreting them across the world. But the orrery's instinct for survival is strong, and its components have a way of inexorably coming together over decades or centuries, found by treasure hunters, stolen by monsters, found and stolen again — and moving closer to each other all the time.\\nRandom Properties.

The armor has been worked to create the appearance of a heavily muscled warrior, and its great helm is unusual in that it has no openings — only a broad glass plate in the front with a second piece of glass above it. Strange plates, tubing, and large metal bosses adorn the armor in seemingly random fashion. On the back of the armor's left gauntlet is a rectangular metal box, from which projects a short rod tipped with a cone-shaped red crystal.\\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:\\n\\nYou have a +1 bonus to AC.\\nYour Strength score is 18 (this has no effect if your Strength is already 18 or higher).\\nYou have advantage on death saving throws.\\n\\nThe armor has further capabilities that can be powered either by energy cells or by your own life energy. You can use a bonus action to draw power from an energy cell or sacrifice hit points to gain one of the following benefits:\\n\\nEmit a force field to gain 2d6 + 5 temporary hit points (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\nActivate boosters to gain a flying speed of 15 feet for 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\nFire arm-mounted laser: Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 120 feet, one target. Hit: 2d6 radiant damage (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\nTranslate any writing you can see in any nonmagical language, to a total of one thousand words over 1 minute (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\nFill the armor with air, allowing you to breathe normally in any environment for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\nGain darkvision to a range of 60 feet for up to 1 hour (1 charge or 5 hit points).\\n\\nThe armor can accept only one energy cell at a time. It is found with one energy cell attached, containing 2d10 charges.\\n\\nPOWERED ARMOR OPTIONS\\nDepending on where and how it appears in the adventure, you might wish to modify the features of Kwalish's legendary powered armor.\\nAutomatic Defenses. Unless Kwalish deactivates the suit's automatic defenses, no one can approach the armor without setting those defenses off. Treat the armor as a shield guardian that has stored a magic missile spell cast using a 4th-level spell slot. When the armor is reduced to 0 hit points, its defenses are rendered inert and it can be safely approached.\\nBattle of Wills. When donned by a new user, the armor deems itself superior and attempts to take possession of that user. The user must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the armor. While possessed, the user is incapacitated and loses control of its body but retains its awareness. The armor uses the possessed user's statistics (as adjusted by the armor), but doesn't gain access to the user's knowledge, features, or proficiencies.\\nFreeing a creature trapped inside the armor first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). The trapped creature can also attempt a DC 20 Charisma saving throw each day at dawn. On a successful save, the armor no longer controls the creature and can be safely donned by that creature at any time.\\nStasis. Whenever a creature wearing the armor drops to 0 hit points, the armor places that creature into a state of stasis. While in this state, the creature is stable and does not make death saving throws, but the armor takes control of the creature (as above). Additionally, the armor attempts to assume the identity of the user, assuring their allies that nothing is amiss. Freeing the user first requires defeating the armor's automatic defenses (as above). A creature in stasis does not make Charisma saving throws to break the armor's control.\\nAlternative Power. Powered armor originally required energy cells to fuel it, but was adapted by Kwalish to be fueled by the life energy of the creature wearing it. You might decide that the armor can also draw power from additional sources, or that energy cells can be recharged with the aid of a tinker, inventor, or artificer. It might also be possible for allies to connect to the armor through the use of magic that generates a conduit something like an astral silver cord. While so connected, a willing ally can give up hit points as a reaction to fuel the armor's abilities.\\n\\n                Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Armor Class, Advantage: Death Saving Throws, Set: Strength Score, Str 15 Required, Stealth Disadvantage","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Lost Laboratory of Kwalish"},{"name":"Prehistoric Figurines of Wondrous Power","rarity":"Varies","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, varies","mainDescription":"Larger and more roughly hewn than typical figurines of wondrous power, these statuettes depict dinosaurs and related creatures from the earliest days of the world.\\nAs an action, you can throw a prehistoric figurine of wondrous power to a point on the ground within 60 feet of yourself while speaking a command word, whereupon the figurine magically transforms into a living creature.

It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can't be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine's description.\\nCarnelian Triceratops (Very Rare). This figurine becomes a triceratops for up to 6 hours and can be ridden as a mount. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 10 days have passed.\\nJasper Tyrannosaurus Rex (Legendary).

The Ring of Winter is a golden band that resizes to fit snugly on the finger of its wearer. A thin layer of frost coats the outside of the ring, which normal heat can't melt. The ring feels ice cold to the touch and initially numbs the hand that wears it, but this cold ceases to be felt by one who is attuned to the ring.\\nThe Ring of Winter is sentient and tries to take control of any creature that wears it (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide). If it succeeds, the ring compels its wearer to cause undue harm to everyone and everything around it, in a cold-hearted attempt to incur the wrath of enemies and bring about the wearer's doom.\\nSentience. The Ring of Winter is a sentient chaotic evil item with an Intelligence of 14, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 17. The ring communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it, and it has hearing and normal vision out to a range of 60 feet. The ring craves destruction, and it likes inflicting indiscriminate harm on others.\\nNondetection. The Ring of Winter defies attempts to magically locate it. Neither the ring nor its wearer can be targeted by any divination magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\\nFrozen Time. As long as you wear the ring, you don't age naturally. This effect is similar to suspended animation, in that your age doesn't catch up to you once the ring is removed. The ring doesn't protect its wearer from magical or supernatural aging effects, such as the Horrifying Visage of a ghost.\\nCold Immunity. While attuned to and wearing the ring, you have immunity to cold damage and don't suffer any ill effects from extreme cold (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\\nMagic. The Ring of Winter has 12 charges and regains all its expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can expend the necessary number of charges to activate one of the following properties:\\n\\nYou can expend 1 charge as an action and use the ring to lower the temperature in a 120-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 300 feet of you. The temperature in that area drops 20 degrees per minute, to a minimum of –30 degrees Fahrenheit. Frost and ice begin to form on surfaces once the temperature drops below 32 degrees. This effect is permanent unless you use the ring to end it as an action, at which point the temperature in the area returns to normal at a rate of 10 degrees per minute.\\nYou can cast one of the following spells from the ring (spell save DC 17) by expending the necessary number of charges: Bigby's hand (2 charges; the hand is made of ice, is immune to cold damage, and deals bludgeoning damage instead of force damage as a clenched fist), cone of cold (2 charges), flesh to ice (3 charges; as flesh to stone except that the target turns to solid ice with the density and durability of stone), ice storm (2 charges), Otiluke's freezing sphere (3 charges), sleet storm (1 charge), spike growth (1 charge; the spikes are made of ice), or wall of ice (2 charges).\\nYou can expend the necessary number of charges as an action and use the ring to create either an inanimate ice object (2 charges) or an animated ice creature (4 charges). The ice object can't have any moving parts, must be able to fit inside a 10-foot cube, and has the density and durability of metal or stone (your choice). The ice creature must be modeled after a beast with a challenge rating of 2 or less. The ice creature has the same statistics as the beast it models, with the following changes: the creature is a construct with vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to cold and poison damage, and immunity to the following conditions: charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned. The ice creature obeys only its creator's commands. The ice object or creature appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of you. It melts into a pool of normal water after 24 hours or when it drops to 0 hit points. In extreme heat, it loses 5 (1d10) hit points per minute as it melts. Use the guidelines in chapter 8 of the Dungeon Master's Guide to determine the hit points of an inanimate object if they become necessary.\\n\\nOther Properties. The Ring of Winter is rumored to possess other properties that can be activated only by an evil being whose will the ring can't break.

The pit fiend won't reveal its true nature,referring to itself only as the Hidden Lord.It drops hints and subtle suggestions that it is an angel trapped in an unholy prison.If released from the shield,the pit fiend honors the terms of whatever bargain it struck to facilitate its escape.\\nWhile trapped in the shield,Gargauth carefully steers the shield's current owner toward committing acts of cruelty and domination, hoping to condemn the individual's soul to the Nine Hells.Conflict occurs if the shield's owner does anything that would make it more difficult for Gargauth to escape its prison, such as leaving the shield in a place where others are unlikely to find it.\\nGargauth doesn't know how to escape from the shield.The pit fiend believes(incorrectly)that it can break free of the shield if it's brought to the Nine Hells, for it's convinced that the shield's powers are weaker there.\\nFreeing Gargauth. Casting dispel evil and good on the shield has a 1 percent chance of freeing the pit fiend, or automatically succeeds if the spell is cast by a solar, a planetar, or an archdevil. A god can release the pit fiend by touching the shield and speaking Gargauth's name.When released,Gargauth appears in a random,unoccupied space as close to the shield as possible.\\n A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand.Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2.You can benefit from only one shield at a time.",

Each coin weighs one-third of a pound, and is inscribed with Infernal writing and a spell that magically binds a single soul to the coin. Because each soul coin has a unique soul trapped within it, each has a story. A creature might have been imprisoned as a result of defaulting on a deal, while another might be the victim of a night hag's curse.\\nCarrying Soul Coins.To hold a soul coin is to feel the soul bound within it — overcome with rage or fraught with despair.\\nAn evil creature can carry as many soul coins as it wishes(up to its maximum weight allowance).A non-evil creature can carry a number of soul coins equal to or less than its Constitution modifier without penalty.A non-evil creature carrying a number of soul coins greater than its Constitution modifier has disadvantage on its attack rolls,ability checks,and saving throws.\\nUsing a Soul Coin.A soul coin has 3 charges.A creature carrying the coin can use its action to expend 1 charge from a soul coin and use it to do one of the following:\\nDrain Life.You siphon away some of the soul's essence and gain 1d10 temporary hit points.\\nQuery. You telepathically ask the soul a question and receive a brief telepathic response, which you can understand. The soul knows only what it knew in life, but it must answer you truthfully and to the best of its ability. The answer is no more than a sentence or two and might be cryptic.\\nFreeing a Soul. Casting a spell that removes a curse on a soul coin frees the soul trapped within it, as does expending all of the coin's charges.The coin itself rusts from within and is destroyed once the soul is released.A freed soul travels to the realm of the god it served or the outer plane most closely tied to its alignment(DM's choice). The souls of lawful evil creatures released from soul coins typically emerge from the River Styx as lemure devils.\\nA soul can also be freed by destroying the coin that contains it. A soul coin has AC 19, 1 hit point for each charge it has remaining, and immunity to all damage except that which is dealt by a hellfire weapon or an infernal war machine's furnace(see \" Soul Fuel \").\\nFreeing a soul from a soul coin is considered a good act, even if the soul belongs to an evil creature.\\nHellish Currency. Soul coins are a currency of the Nine Hells and are highly valued by devils. The coins are used among the infernal hierarchy to barter for favors, bribe the unwilling, and reward the faithful for services rendered.\\nSoul coins are created by Mammon and his greater devils on Minauros, the third layer of the Nine Hells, in a vast chamber where the captured souls of evil mortals are bound into the coins. These coins are then distributed throughout the Nine Hells to be used for goods and services, infernal deals, dark bargains, and bribes.","lowerDescription":"","footerTags":"","sourcebook":"Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus"},{"name":"Sovereign Glue","rarity":"Legendary","type":"Wondrous Item","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Wondrous Item, legendary","mainDescription":"This viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability: conjure elemental (7 charges), dispel magic (3 charges), fireball (7th-level version, 7 charges), flaming sphere (2 charges), ice storm (4 charges), invisibility (2 charges), knock (2 charges), lightning bolt (7th-level version, 7 charges), passwall (5 charges), plane shift (7 charges), telekinesis (5 charges), wall of fire (4 charges), or web (2 charges).\\nYou can also use an action to cast one of the following spells from the staff without using any charges: arcane lock, detect magic, enlarge/reduce, light, mage hand, or protection from evil and good.\\nRetributive Strike. You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.\\nYou have a 50 percent chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.\\n\\n\\n\\nDistance from Origin\\nDamage\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10 ft. away or closer\\n8 x the number of charges in the staff\\n\\n\\n11 to 20 ft. away\\n6 x the number of charges in the staff\\n\\n\\n21 to 30 ft. away\\n4 x the number of charges in the staff","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Spell Attacks, Bonus: Magic, Advantage: Saving Throws, Sorcerer, Warlock, or Wizard, Damage, Control, Detection, Combat, Deception, Warding","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Control\\n                \\n                    Detection\\n                \\n                    Combat\\n                \\n                    Deception\\n                \\n                    Warding","sourcebook":"Basic Rules (2014)"},{"name":"Staff of the Python","rarity":"Uncommon","type":"Staff","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Staff, uncommon (requires attunement by a Cleric, Druid, or Warlock)","mainDescription":"You can use an action to speak this staff's command word and throw the staff on the ground within 10 feet of you.

Whenever the stone desires a new owner, it demands to be given to another intelligent creature as quickly as possible. If its demands are ignored, it tries to take control of its owner (see \"Sentient Magic Items\" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).\\nPersonality. The Stone of Golorr has an alien intellect that is both domineering and hungry for knowledge. It thinks of itself as an ageless and immortal god.\\nDestroying the Stone. While in stone form, the aboleth isn't a creature and isn't subject to effects that target creatures. The Stone of Golorr is immune to all damage. Casting an antipathy/sympathy spell on the stone destroys it if the antipathy effect is selected and the spell is directed to repel aberrations. When the spell is cast in this way, the stone transforms into mucus and is destroyed, and Golorr the aboleth appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the stone's remains.

This despicable villain served as advisor, warlord, and assassin. His successes earned him Vecna's admiration and a reward: a sword with as dark a pedigree as the man who would wield it.\\nFor a long time, Kas faithfully served the lich, but as Kas's power grew, so did his hubris. His sword urged him to supplant Vecna, so that they could rule the lich's empire in Vecna's stead. Legend says Vecna's destruction came at Kas's hand, but Vecna also wrought his rebellious lieutenant's doom, leaving only Kas's sword behind. The world was made brighter thereby.\\nThe Sword of Kas is a magic, sentient longsword that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. It scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20, and deals an extra 2d10 slashing damage to undead.\\nIf the sword isn't bathed in blood within 1 minute of being drawn from its scabbard, its wielder must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a successful save, the wielder take 3d6 psychic damage. On a failed save, the wielder is dominated by the sword, as if by the dominate monster spell, and the sword demands that it be bathed in blood. The spell effect ends when the sword's demand is met.\\nRandom Properties. The Sword of Kas has the following random properties:\\n\\n1 minor beneficial property\\n1 major beneficial property\\n1 minor detrimental property\\n1 major detrimental property\\n\\nSpirit of Kas. While the sword is on your person, you add a d10 to your initiative at the start of every combat. In addition, when you use an action to attack with the sword, you can transfer some or all of its attack bonus to your Armor Class instead. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn.\\nSpells. While the sword is on your person, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: call lightning, divine word, or finger of death. Once you use the sword to cast a spell, you can't cast that spell again from it until the next dawn.\\nSentience. The Sword of Kas is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 15, a Wisdom of 13, and a Charisma of 16. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet.\\nThe weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common.\\nPersonality. The sword's purpose is to bring ruin to Vecna. Killing Vecna's worshipers, destroying the lich's works, and foiling his machinations all help to fulfill this goal.\\nThe Sword of Kas also seeks to destroy anyone corrupted by the Eye and Hand of Vecna. The sword's obsession with those artifacts eventually becomes a fixation for its wielder.\\nDestroying the Sword. A creature attuned to both the Eye of Vecna and the Hand of Vecna can use the wish property of those combined artifacts to unmake the Sword of Kas. The creature must cast the wish spell and make a Charisma check contested by the Charisma check of the sword. The sword must be within 30 feet of the creature, or the spell fails. If the sword wins the contest, nothing happens, and the wish spell is wasted. If the sword loses the contest, it is destroyed.\\n                Proficiency with a longsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Bonus: Initiative, Bonus: Magic, Damage, Buff, Debuff, Combat, Cursed, Versatile","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Buff\\n                \\n                    Debuff\\n                \\n                    Combat\\n                \\n                    Cursed","sourcebook":"Dungeon Master's Guide (2014)"},{"name":"Sword of Life Stealing","rarity":"Rare","type":"Weapon","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Weapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage if it isn't a construct or an undead.

They are a collection of teeth, each suggestive of wildly different origins and made from various materials. The collection rests within a leather pouch, stitched with images of heroes and whimsical creatures. Where the teeth fall, they bring legends to life.\\nUsing the Teeth. While you are holding the pouch, you can use an action to draw one tooth. Roll on the Teeth of Dahlver-Nar table to determine which tooth you draw, and you can either sow the tooth or implant it (both of which are described later).\\nIf you don't sow or implant the tooth, roll a die at the end of your turn. On an even number, the tooth vanishes, and creatures appear as if you sowed the tooth, but they are hostile to you and your allies. On an odd number, the tooth replaces one of your teeth as if you implanted it (potentially replacing another implanted tooth, see below).\\nEach tooth can only be used once. Track which teeth have been used. If a tooth's result is rolled after it's been used, you draw the next lowest unused tooth on the table.\\nSowing Teeth. To sow the tooth, you place it on the ground in an unoccupied space within your reach, or you throw it into an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you in a body of water that is at least 50 feet wide and 50 feet long. Upon doing so, the tooth burrows into the ground and vanishes, leaving no hole behind, or it vanishes into the water. The creatures noted in the Creatures Summoned column appear in an unoccupied space as close to where the tooth was sown as possible. The creatures are allies to you, speak all languages you speak, and linger for 10 minutes before disappearing, unless otherwise noted.\\nImplanting Teeth. To implant the tooth, you place it in your mouth, whereupon one of your own teeth falls out, and the drawn tooth takes its place, resizing to fit in your mouth. Once the tooth is implanted, you gain the effect noted in the Implanted Effect column. The tooth can't be removed while you are attuned to the teeth, and you can't voluntarily end your attunement to them. If removed after your death, the tooth vanishes. You can have a maximum number of the teeth implanted at one time equal to 1 + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 2 teeth total). If you try to implant more teeth, the newly implanted tooth replaces one of the previous teeth, determined randomly. The replaced tooth vanishes, and you lose the implanted effect.\\nRecovering Teeth. Once all the teeth have vanished, their pouch also vanishes. The pouch with all the teeth then appears in a random destination, which could be on a different world of the Material Plane.\\nDestroying the Teeth. Each tooth must be destroyed individually by sowing it in the area where the tooth's story originated, with the intention to destroy it. When planted in this way, creatures summoned are not friendly to you and do not vanish. Some of the creatures summoned merely head off in search of home, while others act as their tales dictate. In either case, the tooth is gone forever.\\nTeeth of Dahlver-Nar\\n\\n\\n\\n1d20\\nTale and Tooth\\nCreatures Summoned\\nImplanted Effect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\nThe Staring Cats of Uldun-dar (ivory cat molar)\\n9 cats\\nThe tooth has 8 charges.

However, its true origins derive from a planar craft that crashed in the Barrier Peaks, for the Infernal Machine once functioned as this craft's central command console.\\nExplorers who discovered the crash site removed the command console and brought it back to civilization, not understanding its true purpose or powers. In later years, the console came into the possession of Baron Lum. By experimenting with its many controls, he was able to achieve astounding and destructive magical effects in the building of his empire, and so the artifact came to be known as the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad. Yet with Lum's eventual defeat, his great machine was destroyed.\\nThe Infernal Machine is a delicate, intricate, bulky, and heavy device, weighing some 5,500 pounds. It can be operated using a control panel containing sixty levers, forty dials, twenty switches, and a number of jeweled components. These controls generate all kinds of powers and effects, as noted below.\\nSilver Wire. The Infernal Machine's great size makes it largely immobile. To make ongoing use of the machine (such as while adventuring), it can be connected to its attuned user by a silver wire, a supply of which can always be produced from the machine's inner workings. This silver wire shares the same general nature as the silvery cord of an astral projection spell, connecting to the body of the user and trailing behind them. When so attached, the wire becomes invisible, astral, and extends to virtually infinite length.\\nAs long as the wire remains intact, the attuned user can make full use of the Infernal Machine's powers, with their effects centered around the user. If the wire is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it can cut an astral projection's silvery cord—the user suffers a sudden burst of feedback from the machine that kills them instantly.\\nAny effect of the Infernal Machine that requires concentration can be concentrated on by a remote user. The Infernal Machine's effects have a spell save DC of 14 or the attuned user's spell save DC, whichever is higher.\\nSummon Monster. When first used by Baron Lum, the Infernal Machine was known for its ability to unleash terrible monsters within the world. Specific combinations of its controls can still recreate the effects of various spells of the conjuration school, as follows:\\n1/day: conjure animals, summon lesser demons\\n1/7 days: conjure minor elementals, conjure woodland beings, summon greater demon\\n1/month: conjure elemental, conjure fey\\nWish. The Infernal Machine has the ability to bend the nature of reality, with the proper combination of controls recreating the effect of a wish spell (including all side effects). Due to the complex nature of its programming, this feature can be used only once per month. Each time this effect is used, there is a cumulative 10 percent chance of the Infernal Machine malfunctioning, necessitating seven days' worth of repairs and reprogramming, as well as the expenditure of 500 gp in parts, before it can be used again. When these repairs are done, the cumulative chance of malfunction returns to 10 percent.\\nRandom Properties. There are far more possible combinations for the Infernal Machine's controls than can ever be known or matrixed—especially as the controls shift position and reset themselves over time. At the end of each long rest of the user attuned to it, the Infernal Machine generates 1d4 + 1 random beneficial properties and 1d4 + 1 detrimental properties. Roll for each of these properties on the Infernal Machine Properties table. To keep things interesting, the DM might roll secretly for detrimental properties, revealing those properties only during the course of play.\\nOnce set, these properties last until the end of the attuned user's next long rest.\\n(Our thanks to the D&D community for their suggestions for the properties of the Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad!)\\nDestroying the Machine. The Infernal Machine of Lum the Mad is self-repairing of anything short of catastrophic damage, and how it was disabled in Lum's time remains a mystery. It is rumored that if one specific combination of controls is set, the Infernal Machine will enter a repair mode, allowing unfettered access to its inner workings—and preventing it from restoring itself if it is attacked. Alternatively, other combinations of controls might cause the Infernal Machine to teleport its most critical components to some hiding place deep in space and time, rendering it inoperable until those components are found again.\\nInfernal Machine Properties\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nd100\\nBeneficial Property\\nDetrimental Property\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n01\\nYou have a flying speed of 150 feet but lose all other movement.\\nYou are blinded.\\n\\n\\n02\\nYou can cast the speak with animals spell at will, but can use it to speak with only one animal of your choice.\\nAll animals despise you.

When it does, it magically appears wherever its master senses an opportunity to achieve some fell goal.\\nMade from bones as hard as iron, the wand is topped with a magically enlarged skull that once belonged to a human hero slain by Orcus. The wand can magically change in size to better conform to the grip of its user. Plants wither, drinks spoil, flesh rots, and vermin thrive in the wand's presence.\\nAny creature besides Orcus that tries to attune to the wand must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw.

When you hit with a ranged weapon attack using it, the target takes an extra 1d8 bludgeoning damage, or an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage if the target is a giant.

The throne hovers a foot off the ground and is a massive thing made of polished obsidian with oversized feet — the impaled skulls of four ancient blue dragons. Runes glisten in the carved obsidian, winking to life with blue energy when the throne's powers are activated.\\nAfter the fall of Shanatar, the Wyrmskull Throne fell into the clutches of less honorable creatures. A band of adventurers wrested the throne from the aquatic elf tyrant Gantar Kraok and sold it to the storm giant Neri for a considerable fortune. Neri had the throne magically enlarged and gave it to her husband, King Hekaton, as a gift, along with one of the Ruling Scepters of Shanatar, which she had found in a wreck at the bottom of the Trackless Sea. Only a creature attuned to a Ruling Scepter and in possession of it can harness the powers of the Wyrmskull Throne, which has become the centerpiece of King Hekaton's throne room in the undersea citadel of Maelstrom. Fear of the throne's power has helped prevent evil giants from challenging or threatening Hekaton's leadership.\\nAny creature not attuned to a Ruling Scepter who sits on the throne is paralyzed and encased in a magical force field. While encased, the creature can't be touched or moved from the throne. Touching a Ruling Scepter to the force field dispels the field, though the creature remains paralyzed until it is separated from the throne.\\nAny creature seated on the throne can hear faint whispers in Draconic — the whisperings of the four blue dragons whose skulls adorn the throne. Although powerless, these spirits try to influence the decisions of the throne's master.\\nProperties of the Throne. The throne has 9 charges and regains all expended charges daily at dawn. A creature that sits on the throne while attuned to a Ruling Scepter in its possession can harness the throne's properties, which are as follows:\\n\\nThe throne gains a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover and flies where the creature wills. This property doesn't expend any charges.\\nBoth the throne and the creature sitting on it can move through earth and stone without disturbing the material they move through. This property doesn't expend any charges.\\nAs an action, the creature can expend 1 charge to cast lightning bolt (spell save DC 19) from the throne. The spell is cast as though using a 9th-level spell slot and deals 49 (14d6) lightning damage. The bolt discharges from the mouth of one of the throne's blue dragon skulls.\\nAs an action, the creature can expend 2 charges to cast the globe of invulnerability spell from the throne. The globe encloses both the creature and the throne.\\nAs an action, the creature can expend 3 charges to create a spectral image of an ancient blue dragon that surrounds both it and the throne. The spectral dragon lasts for 1 minute.\\nAt the end of each of the creature's turns, the spectral dragon makes one bite attack and two claw attacks against targets of the creature's choice. These attacks have the same attack bonus, reach, and damage as an ancient blue dragon's bite and claw attacks. \\n\\nDestroying the Throne. The Wyrmskull Throne can be destroyed by breaking at least five Ruling Scepters of Shanatar simultaneously on it. This fact has never been recorded or sung of among the dwarves or any bards or storytellers, and it can't be discovered with an ability check. Characters who want to destroy the throne must go on a quest to learn the method for doing so. The throne's destruction triggers an explosion, as shards of obsidian fly out in all directions. Each creature and object within a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on the throne must succeed on a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.","lowerDescription":"Notes: Set: Innate Speed (Flying), Damage, Movement, Warding","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Damage\\n                \\n                    Movement\\n                \\n                    Warding","sourcebook":"Storm King's Thunder"},{"name":"Yester Hill Axe","rarity":"Unknown Rarity","type":"Weapon\\n        \\n        \\n            Battleaxe","attunement":false,"upperDescription":"Weapon (battleaxe),  unknown rarity","mainDescription":"Its handle is carved with leaves and vines, and the weapon weighs half as much as a normal battleaxe.

The globe sheds bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 300 feet. The globe draws magic from the Weave that can be harnessed for various purposes. For example, Netherese mages used mythallars to keep their cities aloft and empower their magic items. The bigger the mythallar, the more magic it can hold. The largest mythallars are 150 feet in diameter.\\nThe Ythryn mythallar is a relatively small device—a mere 50 feet in diameter. To attune to this mythallar, a creature must finish a short rest within 30 feet of it, meditating on the mythallar. Up to eight creatures can be attuned to it at one time; otherwise, the Ythryn mythallar follows the attunement rules in the Dungeon Master's Guide. If a ninth creature tries to attune to the mythallar, nothing happens.\\nAll creatures attuned to the Ythryn mythallar can sense when the device is being used. A creature attuned to the device can use any of its properties, but only if all other creatures attuned to the device agree to allow it. The Ythryn mythallar's properties are as follows:\\n\\nWhile you're on the same plane of existence as the Ythryn mythallar, you can use an action to cause it to fly in any direction you choose at a speed of 30 feet. All matter within 500 feet of the device moves with it. The Ythryn mythallar and all structures held aloft by it hover in place when not in motion.\\nAs an action, you can cause one magic item you are holding within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar to immediately regain all its expended charges or uses. A magic item recharged in this manner can't be recharged by the Ythryn mythallar again until after the item regains expended charges or uses on its own.\\nYou can use the Ythryn mythallar to cast the control weather spell without requiring any components and without the need for you to be outdoors. This casting of the spell has a 50-mile radius. For the duration of the spell's casting time, you must be within 30 feet of the Ythryn mythallar or the spell fails.\\n\\nTouching the Mythallar. Any creature that touches the globe of the mythallar must make a DC 22 Constitution saving throw, taking 180 (20d10 + 70) radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Undead have disadvantage on this saving throw. Any object that touches the globe, other than an artifact or the mythallar's cradle, is disintegrated instantly (no save).","lowerDescription":"Notes: spellcaster, Control","footerTags":"Tags: \\n                \\n                    Control","sourcebook":"Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden"},{"name":"Zephyr Armor","rarity":"Rare","type":"Armor","attunement":true,"upperDescription":"Armor (light), rare (requires attunement)","mainDescription":"This fine set of white-and-silver armor bears the wind rune upon its chest.\\nWhile wearing this armor, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks and Dexterity saving throws as your movements are bolstered by gentle currents of wind.\\nInvoking the Rune.
